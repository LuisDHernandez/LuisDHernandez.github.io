## Welcome

I am Luis Hernandez. I am Cuban-American and have been in love with gaming and coding since I was a child. Now in my adulthood, I can chase a profession that is my dream come true. Every day that goes by I hope I can improve myself and help others see the greatness of programming and its applications everywhere. Currently, I am enrolled at Florida Gulf Coast University to pursue my B.S. in Software Engineering, and shortly after that, I plan on obtaining a M.S. in Software Engineering.
